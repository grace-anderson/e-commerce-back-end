## Project Description 
This project is an e-commerce back end built by configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit you as a small business owner, a start up team member, or a junior developer.

Because this application is not deployed, **TO DO Link ** a walkthrough video is provided to demonstrate the e-commerce back end's use and functionality. 

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/e-commerce-back-end) for the e-commerce back end.
